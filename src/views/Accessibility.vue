                <p style="text-align:left">
                    The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) define requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.
                    We strive for WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance on all USDS Products. In addition, we also follow some Level AAA Success Criteria (such as providing visually hidden text for ambiguous links and buttons).
                    Because the site is constantly in development, some areas may not consistently reflect adherence to this standard.
